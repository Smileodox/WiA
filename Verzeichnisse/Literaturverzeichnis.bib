Diese Diskussion beginnen wir nun also. Aber wir weisen -- wie schon so oft -- gleich hier wieder einmal auf Folgendes hin: Eine eingehende und tiefgreifende Analyse des Begriffs der Volatilit{\"a}t bedarf einer intensiven Besch{\"a}ftigung und weiterf{\"u}hrender mathematischer Techniken. In Band I unserer Abhandlung werden wir uns daher wieder auf die notwendigen Konzepte und Eigenschaften beschr{\"a}nken m{\"u}ssen. Das Ziel hier wird sein: Den Begriff der Volatilit{\"a}t und die damit verbundenen wesentlichsten Techniken so weit zu begreifen, dass wir das R{\"u}stzeug haben um grundlegende Anwendungen in exakter Weise und mit gut argumentierbaren Methoden durchf{\"u}hren zu k{\"o}nnen (freilich immer im Wissen darum, dass tiefergehende „more advanced`` Methoden und Modelle m{\"o}glicher Weise noch tiefere Einsichten in die jeweilige Anwendung geben k{\"o}nnten).},

  abstract  = {There is a growing body of evidence that numerical uncertainty expressions can be used by non-experts to improve decision quality. Moreover, there is some evidence that similar advantages extend to graphic expressions of uncertainty. However, visualizing uncertainty introduces challenges as well. Here, we discuss key misunderstandings that may arise from uncertainty visualizations, in particular the evidence that users sometimes fail to realize that the graphic depicts uncertainty. Instead they have a tendency to interpret the image as representing some deterministic quantity. We refer to this as the deterministic construal error. Although there is now growing evidence for the deterministic construal error, few studies are designed to detect it directly because they inform participants upfront that the visualization expresses uncertainty. In a natural setting such cues would be absent, perhaps making the deterministic assumption more likely. Here we discuss the psychological roots of this key but underappreciated misunderstanding as well as possible solutions. This is a critical question because it is now clear that members of the public understand that predictions involve uncertainty and have greater trust when uncertainty is included. Moreover, they can understand and use uncertainty predictions to tailor decisions to their own risk tolerance, as long as they are carefully expressed, taking into account the cognitive processes involved.}

We derive an approximation of advection uncertainty due to interpolation and incorporate this uncertainty into our visualization of trajectories. Our work enables efficient visual pruning of unlikely results, especially in regions of atmospheric shear, potentially reducing erroneous interpretations. Finally, we apply these methods to a real-world meteorological problem to demonstrate its use.}

abstract = {This article described three heuristics that are employed in making judgments under uncertainty: (i) representativeness, which is usually employed when people are asked to judge the probability that an object or event A belongs to class or process B; (ii) availability of instances or scenarios, which is often employed when people are asked to assess the frequency of a class or the plausibility of a particular development; and (iii) adjustment from an anchor, which is usually employed in numerical prediction when a relevant value is available. These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors. A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgments and decisions in situations of uncertainty.}}

Existing uncertainty visualizations may not align with user needs or how they naturally reason about probability. We present a novel mobile interface design and visualization of uncertainty for transit predictions on mobile phones based on discrete outcomes. To develop it, we identified domain specific design requirements for visualizing uncertainty in transit prediction through: 1) a literature review, 2) a large survey of users of a popular realtime transit application, and 3) an iterative design process. We present several candidate visualizations of uncertainty for realtime transit predictions in a mobile context, and we propose a novel discrete representation of continuous outcomes designed for small screens, quantile dotplots. In a controlled experiment we find that quantile dotplots reduce the variance of probabilistic estimates by ~1.15 times compared to density plots and facilitate more confident estimation by end-users in the context of realtime transit prediction scenarios.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems}, pages = {5092–5103}, numpages = {12}, keywords = {dotplots, end-user visualization, mobile interfac-es, transit predictions, uncertainty visualization}, location = {San Jose, California, USA}, series = {CHI '16} }

Evaluations of uncertainty displays for transit prediction have assessed people's ability to extract probabilities, but not the quality of their decisions. In a controlled, incentivized experiment, we had subjects decide when to catch a bus using displays with textual uncertainty, uncertainty visualizations, or no-uncertainty (control). Frequency-based visualizations previously shown to allow people to better extract probabilities (quantile dotplots) yielded better decisions. Decisions with quantile dotplots with 50 outcomes were(1) better on average, having expected payoffs 97\% of optimal(95\% CI: [95\%,98\%]), 5 percentage points more than control (95\% CI: [2,8]); and (2) more consistent, having within-subject standard deviation of 3 percentage points (95\% CI:[2,4]), 4 percentage points less than control (95\% CI: [2,6]).Cumulative distribution function plots performed nearly as well, and both outperformed textual uncertainty, which was sensitive to the probability interval communicated. We discuss implications for real time transit predictions and possible generalization to other domains.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems}, pages = {1–12}, numpages = {12}, keywords = {cumulative distribution plots, dotplots, mobileinterfaces, transit predictions, uncertainty visualization}, location = {, Montreal QC, Canada, }, series = {CHI '18} }
